    text: "We've been working with Magda for our SMSF services since May 2021, and the difference has been remarkable. Before partnering with her, we were using an online provider that was unable to support the complexity of our investment strategy. Magda brought a level of expertise and personalised service that gave us complete confidence in the management of our fund. She's knowledgeable, responsive, and a true pleasure to work with. We highly recommend Magda and the team at Magnified SMSF Specialists to anyone seeking trusted, professional SMSF advice.",

Their depth of knowledge, particularly around complex matters like bringing my SMSF over from the UK, has been truly impressive. They've consistently gone above and beyond, providing expert guidance and proactive support at every step. What I value most is their integrity, professionalism, and genuine commitment to getting the best outcomes for their clients. I highly recommend Magnified to anyone looking for trusted SMSF advice and a team that genuinely cares.",

    text: 'When my husband and I started setting up our superannuation funds, looking ahead to retirement, a wonderful young lady named Magda Betlem came into our lives. Over the many years since, Magda has truly been my rock. She provided all the available information, clearly explained the pros and cons of each option, and guided me in a way that allowed me to see the long-term and short-term benefits for myself. When my husband suddenly passed away seven years ago, Magda was there once again to guide and assist me every step of the way. She is the most honest and wonderful person. I have recommended her to others in the past and continue to do so. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to her once again.',
